# cpp-assignments
A collection of all school assignments done in C++, including but not limited to programming techniques, data structures & algorithms, and operating systems.
This repository was originally created for the purpose of transferring projects between my own devices, but now serves as a good reference for many of the concepts learned in class.

NOTE: Assignments created for CSCE 240 were created with external unit tests in mind, and as such will not run on their own without the addition of a main method.
